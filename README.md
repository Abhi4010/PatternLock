# PatternLock

An Android library for pattern lock.

## PatternLock or LockPattern?

The original view in AOSP is named `LockPatternView`, however I believe it is named so because it displays the (screen lock) pattern, instead of the pattern as a lock. Since this library is to provide the pattern as a locking mechanism, I'd prefer naming it `PatternLock`.
